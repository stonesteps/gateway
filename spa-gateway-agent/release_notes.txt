 0.0.1 07-22-16
 - added fix to manually trigger reset of RX on serial port of TS-7970 only(ttyMAX0) when too much time has elapsed and no rs485 received,
   due to bug on TS-7970 uart interrupt handler getting stuck
 - added fix to trigger reset of Linux WPA on Wifi for TS-7970 only. The Wifi/WPA stack on TS7970 has tendency
   to have wifi network device get stuck in unassociated ap mode when the ap goes offline and then comes back
   restarting wpa forces the wifi to physically reconnect to ap which gets it out of stuck unassociated state.

0.0.1 07-25-16
 - fixed rs485 RX/TX frame timing issue on RZ/A1L processor. The RX loop had to be refactored to parse incoming faster
   in general. Changed RX parser to route incoming messages that require an immediate TX response such as DevicePoll, AddressAssignmentAck
   to perform the TX immediately so as to fall within pack's frame timing. Muted extra logging statements.
